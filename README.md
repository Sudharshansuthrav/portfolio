## 🌟 What This Project Does

This repo holds a **static personal portfolio website** — a digital stage for your coding story. It’s the place where you turn your GitHub repo list, project highlights, and personal flair into a *single expressive experience* people can open in a browser.  

It’s crafted with plain **HTML markup**, styled with **CSS**, and powered by a bit of **JavaScript** for interactive elements like menus or animations.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Your portfolio is the oldest trick in the book, but still the most potent:

- **Shows your code in context** — way better than a resume alone. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Connects dots** between skills and real visible work.  
- Serves as a **launch pad** for interviews, freelance pitches, and personal branding.  
- A developer’s home turf that you control — no algorithm changes can steal your story.
